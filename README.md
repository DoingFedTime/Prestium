# Prestium

Prestium is an linux os that natively runs I2P. It's a live disk.  
I (Doingfedtime) am NOT the creator of this. 
The creator had said on reddit that he would not be making a repo for this, I thought from 
what I had saw that it was to good not to share with the world in this way. 

The torrent file is made by me. The download off the creators website is slow and took me forever. 
This torrent file is hosted on a seedbox, so there should be NO issues with speed when downloading it. 

Please, seed. I will not be paying for the seedbox for a second month! 

If you want a direct link to the ISO you can find it here:
https://reserves_p31360:bemepepe12@nascar.myseedbox.site/private/Downloads/Prestium-1.2.1-amd64.iso

Dont download it like that though. Grab the torret and share at least what you take. 

The creators name on reddit (and only reddit) is: u/Opicaak

The subreddit for this disto is here: r/prestium
